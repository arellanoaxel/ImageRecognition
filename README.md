# Image Recognition

This repository contains code for performing image recognition using Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, and DBSCAN.
The goal of this project is to compare and contrast these algorithms, finding which algorithim performs best in certain situations.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [LILA Science](https://lila.science/datasets/ena24detection).

## Usage
1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Click on the link provided above to download the dataset.
   - The dataset should include a JSON file and a folder containing approximately 1000 images.

2. **Process the Images:**
   - Run the `processImages.py` script to preprocess the images for the algorithms.

3. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - As the project evolves, additional Python files representing different algorithms will be added.
   - Each Python file corresponds to a different algorithm. (K-Means in devlopment)

4. **Preprocessed Data:**
   - Ensure that the algorithms are applied only on the preprocessed data.
